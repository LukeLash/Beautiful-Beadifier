# Beautiful-Beaderizer
Visualizes an image as a large set of fuse beads (e.g., Perler Beads) for home decor. This program will match the the colors found in an input image and match them to the most similar real-world fuse bead product.

The inspiration for this project comes from https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/jas2w4/how_op_made_leonardo_dicaprio/




**grayscaleOutput = True**

in the main.py file.


The colorscale matching of real-world beads is currently under construction. One (possibly failed) approach to this is shown in the **TEST_CIELAB_ColorMatcher.py** file.

Suggestions are always welcome!
